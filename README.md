Financial calculus is not typically a core requirement for solicitors, as their primary focus is on legal matters such as drafting contracts, providing legal advice, and representing clients in court. 

However, certain areas of legal practice do require a good understanding of financial concepts, models and calculus and can give solicitors a competitive edge, particularly in those areas involving financial transactions, contracts, and disputes.

Commercial Law
- Understanding financial statements: In commercial law, solicitors often deal with company finances, business transactions, and mergers. A strong grasp of financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, and cash flows) is crucial.
- Valuation of assets and businesses: Solicitors involved in mergers and acquisitions need to understand financial models to evaluate the value of companies or assets.
- Interest calculations: Financial calculus helps with understanding interest rates and loan amortization schedules.

Tax Law
- Tax computations: Solicitors working in tax law need to compute taxes, understand tax implications of financial transactions, and may require some familiarity with mathematical models to ensure accurate tax planning and compliance.
- Capital gains and losses: Understanding the timing and calculation of capital gains or losses over time, including any taxation on deferred gains.

Property Law
- Mortgages and loan agreements: A basic understanding of financial calculus, particularly compound interest, is useful in drafting and negotiating loan agreements and mortgages.
- Valuation of real estate: Property law solicitors might need to assess the financial aspects of real estate transactions, including valuing property based on potential future returns.

Corporate and Insolvency Law
- Debt restructuring: Solicitors in corporate restructuring or insolvency may deal with complex financial arrangements and restructuring plans, which require an understanding of interest rates, debt recovery, financial modeling and valuation methods.
- Financial risk assessments: Solicitors may be called upon to analyze financial risks and assist with formulating strategies to mitigate them.

Litigation
- Damages calculation: In litigation, especially commercial litigation, solicitors may need to calculate damages, which could involve present value or future value calculations, applying discount rates, or understanding the economic impact of interest rates over time.
- Financial settlements: In cases involving financial settlements, a solicitor may need to calculate how much should be paid, factoring in interest, inflation, or depreciation over time.

**Core Mathematical and Financial Skills for Solicitors**

Mathematical:
- Arithmetic and Basic Algebra: Understanding ratios, percentages, algebraic functions and solving basic equations.
- Basic Statistics: In some areas, understanding probability and statistics may be useful, particularly in litigation.
- For most solicitors, proficiency in <ins>Excel or Google Sheets</ins> is more relevant than pure mathematical skills.

Financial:
- Time Value of Money: Familiarity with present value (PV), future value (FV), discounting, and compounding interest rates.
- Interest Rate Calculations: Ability to calculate simple and compound interest, which is vital for mortgages, loans, and other financial agreements.
- Risk Management: Familiarity with financial risk assessments, particularly in the context of corporate law, litigation, and insolvency.

**Skills That Support Financial Calculus Knowledge**
- Attention to Detail: To ensure accurate calculations in complex financial matters.

>  Lawyers negotiate deals and manage lawsuits involving billions of dollars each year. To do that, you need more than legal expertise. You need a fundamental understanding of the finances behind a deal or dispute, including how to read and analyze financial statements or use financial concepts to value a business, patent, or marital estate. You need more than law knowledge to advise a client on any significant transaction â€” and to help a client even assess whether it's best to pursue a claim or to settle.

>  Successful attorneys cannot leave accounting, finance and valuation solely to a finance team, or outside experts. You need to independently understand the financial opportunities your client faces and discuss them using the language of finance. Through examples of disputes, valuations, and presentations from real-world practitioners, this course will teach you how to interpret and use financial data, make a business case for a deal or lawsuit, and understand when and how experts can support â€” or undermine â€” your work.

- Deriving the fair value of a company using Comparable Company analysis and DCF models.

>  **Takeaways**
- Accounting, finance, and valuation are key elements in many legal disputes.
- Present value, discounting, the perpetuity formula, Comparable Company analysis and the DCF model are all used by solictors in various ways in real lawsuits.

**Blog 01 / Mind your Business: Valuing Corporate Assets on Divorce (Kingsley Napley, 2024)** 

With over 800,000 businesses incorporated in the UK every year, it is no surprise that business assets and in particular the disposal of business interests are often a significant issue when dividing assets between separating spouses in financial remedy proceedings. 

>In the recent High Court case of GA v EL (2023), the court considered the effect of post-separation endeavour on the value of a business.  In this particular case, the parties had a long marriage of 12 years and 2 children together. The former family home was transferred into the wifeâ€™s sole name, but the parties were unable to agree the division of the Â£70 million business proceeds which made up the bulk of their assets.

>The husbandâ€™s case was that a significant part of the business proceeds derived from 2 years and 2 months of post-separation endeavour and were therefore non-matrimonial. However, the wife argued that the totality of the business was matrimonial and the increase in value was growth from matrimonial efforts and the subsequent natural growth which an established business could expect in a strong market.

>The parties instructed a single joint expert (SJE), i.e. an expert who is appointed by the court where both of the parties have conduct of the instruction. The SJE valued the business at the date of separation (November 2019) at Â£28.1 million, using a â€˜present day approachâ€™, where the SJE effectively transported himself to 2019 and did not have consideration to the subsequent years, resulting in the business selling in 2021 for Â£70 million. The judge adopted the figures of Â£30 million for the valuation at separation and Â£60 million at the time of sale. The lower valuation was to account for the fragility of the figures as upon sale some of the consideration was deferred as equity in a holding company.

>The court ordered a division of 42.5% of the proceeds to the wife and 57.5% to the husband, which put the husbandâ€™s post-separation endeavour at approximately 15%.

Should either party be dissatisfied with the single joint expert report, then it is open for them to make a *Daniels v Walker* application[^1].

*Kingsley Napley is a London-based law firm, authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The firm's practice areas include: Corporate, Commercial & Finance, Costs & Litigation Management, Dispute Resolution, Family and Divorce, Real Estate & Construction, and Restructuring and Insolvency. (Source: Wikipedia).*

[^1]: In certain situations, one or both parties may want to consult an expert of their own choosing to determine whether to challenge the single joint expertâ€™s report. In the UK this process, now referred to as a Daniels v Walker application, originates from the 2000 case where such a ruling was first made. It applies to all court matters requiring expert evidence. Even when appointed by one party, these experts must remain impartial.
