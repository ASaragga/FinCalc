Financial calculus is not typically a core requirement for solicitors, as their primary focus is on legal matters such as drafting contracts, providing legal advice, and representing clients in court. 

However, certain areas of legal practice do require a good understanding of financial concepts, models and calculus and can give solicitors a competitive edge, particularly in those areas involving financial transactions, contracts, and disputes.

# Law and Finance Around the World

**Financial Analysis and Valuation for Lawyers (Harvard Law School)**. 
Teaches solicitors and lawyers how to analyze financial statements, understand valuation methods, and apply them in legal contexts such as M&A or bankruptcy. (â­£Video)

>  Lawyers negotiate deals and manage lawsuits involving billions of dollars each year. To do that, you need more than legal expertise. You need a fundamental understanding of the finances behind a deal or dispute, including how to read and analyze financial statements or use financial concepts to value a business, patent, or marital estate. You need more than law knowledge to advise a client on any significant transaction â€” and to help a client even assess whether it's best to pursue a claim or to settle.

>  Successful attorneys cannot leave accounting, finance and valuation solely to a finance team, or outside experts. You need to independently understand the financial opportunities your client faces and discuss them using the language of finance. Through examples of disputes, valuations, and presentations from real-world practitioners, this course will teach you how to interpret and use financial data, make a business case for a deal or lawsuit, and understand when and how experts can support â€” or undermine â€” your work.

# Going Global: International Trade & Business âˆ© Finance âˆ© Law

**International Trade**. In international trade finance, several financial products and instruments are commonly used to mitigate risks, improve liquidity and ensure smooth and secure cross-border transactions in international trade. Here are the main financial products:
- **Letters of Credit (LC)**. It is a guarantee from a bank that the seller will receive payment from the buyer, provided specific conditions (such as shipping documents) are met. Types of LCs: Revocable, Irrevocable, Confirmed, Unconfirmed, Standby LC.
- **Bank Guarantees**. A Bank Guarantee assures that the bank will cover a debtorâ€™s obligations in case they default. It serves as a form of insurance for international transactions.
- **Documentary Collections**. A bank acts as an intermediary to collect payment from the buyer on behalf of the seller upon presentation of shipping or financial documents. This includes: (i) Documents Against Payment (D/P) where the buyer can only receive the documents when they make payment, (ii) Documents Against Acceptance (D/A) where the buyer receives the documents upon agreeing to pay at a later date.
- **Trade Credit**. In supplier credit the exporter allows the importer to pay after the goods have been delivered. In buyer credit a loan offered to the buyer to finance the purchase, usually provided by the exporterâ€™s bank.
- **Factoring**. Involves selling receivables (invoices) to a third party (the factor) at a discount. This provides immediate cash flow for exporters.
- **Forfaiting**. It is the purchase of future payment obligations from an exporter in exchange for immediate payment, typically used for medium- to long-term trade finance.
- **Export Credit Insurance**. Protects exporters against the risk of non-payment by foreign buyers due to commercial or political risks.
- **Trade Finance Loans**. Banks provide loans specifically for the purchase or sale of goods in international trade. These are often short-term and cover the transaction's financial needs.
- **Pre-shipment and Post-shipment Financing**. Pre-shipment finance is provided to an exporter to fund working capital requirements before the goods are shipped. Post-shipment finance is provided to the exporter once goods are shipped but payment from the buyer is delayed.
- **Foreign Exchange (FX) Contracts**. FX Forwards and FX Options allow companies to hedge against currency risks in international trade transactions.


**Foreign Direct Investment: Establishing New Operations and Mergers & Aquisitions**. Direct investment implies a long-term interest and a significant degree of influence or control over the business operations. Itâ€™s different from portfolio investment, where investors simply purchase financial assets like stocks or bonds without control over the business. Foreign Direct Investment refers to a direct investment made by a company or individual from one country into business interests in another country,
